# git-project-knights-travails
This project uses Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path for a knight on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The knightMoves(start, end) function calculates and prints the minimum number of moves and the path taken. It considers the knight's legal "L-shaped" moves in all 8 directions.
